# TypeScript

- Prefer `const` and explicit types where they help readability.
- Use async/await; avoid raw `.then()` chains.
- In Fastify: use `reply`/`request` types from `fastify`; type route handlers and plugins.
- Export from `index` files where it keeps imports clean (e.g. `routes/index.ts`).
